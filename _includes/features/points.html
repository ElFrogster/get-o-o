        <h2>Everything is transparent</h2>
        <p>From start to finish, every package which goes into the distributions has all of its sources and build scripts openly visible for everyone to see. Doubtful of a source? Just check it out on the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org">build service</a></p>

        <h2>Free software? Your choice</h2>
        <p>Packages in the distributions are divided into free and non-free repositories. Don't want to use non-free packages? You can easily disable the non-free repository. It's your choice, not ours.</p>
